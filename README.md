# Vigilant Access Manager (Development Stage)


Welcome to the Vigilant Access Manager (VAM) repository. We're in the early stages of developing a comprehensive access management system designed to provide secure and efficient remote and local asset management. As we continue to build, here are some of the key features we're working on:

## Planned Features

1. **Robust Logging System:** A sophisticated logging system is in the blueprint, which will record all user interactions for comprehensive auditing and analysis. It is anticipated to illuminate asset usage trends and potential security concerns.


2. **Secure Asset Management:** The system will facilitate secure and safe management of assets, both remotely and locally. The API under development will prioritize security, offering robust controls for asset management.


3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** To maintain security, the system will include fine-grained access control based on user roles. It is designed to ensure that users are only able to perform authorized actions, thereby minimizing the potential for security breaches.

4. **Command Control for Remote Access:** The project aims to include a feature to scrutinize and control users' commands during remote access, creating an additional layer of security.

Vigilant Access Manager, although in its development phase, aims to deliver a comprehensive solution to digital asset management. As it progresses, further updates and detailed descriptions of its features will be shared in this repository.
